# Property Prices: Privacy Policy

Welcome to the Property Prices app for Android!

This is a Xamarin app developed by Drew Morgan. The app is available on Google Play, is provided at no cost and is intended for use as is.

I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps attempt to collect your data without your knowledge and I value your trust in using this app.

Please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee the
absolute security of any data your device transmits.

All property transfer/sale data is in the public domain and is provided by HM Land Registry. More information, and the data itself, can be found at
[gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads).

## How your data is used

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data is processed **ephemerally**. That means it is only stored in memory
temporarily, and is only accessed and used while the app is processing a request (trying to work something out); after this the data is discarded. Usually this
means the data is held for no longer than a few seconds.

The app is designed to return data based on a location, which can be either a UK postcode or GPS coordinates. To do this it communicates with another service
on the Internet known as an API (Application Programming Interface) running on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). The API with which it communicates was also
written by me. I will call this the **Heroku API**. Data sent to the Heroku API is also processed ephemerally.

### Looking up a location by postcode

If you choose to request property prices for a specific UK postcode, the app will send that postcode to the Heroku API and should subsequently receive data
pertaining to that postcode's property sales.

### Looking up location names

If you grant the app access to your location, and request property prices for your location, the app will send your location's GPS coordinates to the Heroku
API. The location will be used to find the closest UK postcode(s), and the app should subsequently receive data pertaining to that location's property sales.

### Ads

Banners ads appear on the Browse and About pages in the app; these are provided through Google AdMob.

Taken from [the Google AdMob site](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/data-disclosure):

"To improve the performance of AdMob, the Google Mobile Ads SDK may collect certain information from apps, including:

- IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
- Non-user related crash logs, which may be used to diagnose problems and improve the SDK. Diagnostic information may also be used for advertising and analytics purposes.
- User-associated performance data such as app launch time, hang rate, or energy usage, which may be used to evaluate user behavior, understand the effectiveness of existing product features, and plan new features. Performance data may also be used for displaying ads, including sharing with other entities that display ads.
- A Device ID such as the device's advertising identifier or other app-bounded device identifiers, which may be used for the purpose of third-party advertising and analytics.
- Advertising data, such as advertisements the user has seen, may be used to power analytics and advertising features.
- Other user product interactions like app launch taps, and interaction information, like video views, may be used to improve advertising performance."

This data is governed by Google's [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Error reporting

To improve the stability and user experience of the app, errors may be reported to the Google Play Store as they occur. This data may include information such
as your device model, operating system, and current IP address.

This data is governed by Google's [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Changes to this privacy policy

I may update this policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting
the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2022-06-21.
